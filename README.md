# iPhone-Stopwatch
A replica iPhone Stopwatch

**[How to Run and Use]:**

- Clone the repository onto your machine using git tools [git clone https://github.com/metoajagu/iPhone-Stopwatch]
- Open the whole repository folder in VSCode with Live Server extension enabled
- Open the webiste on a browser [Chrome or Firefox]
- Use the Stop Watch

**[Bugs/Things to Fix]:**

- The Lap button does't actually do what the real iPhone stop watch does, instead of mapping the elasped time that has passed since the user last pressed the lap button it just records the time that the button was pressed. This is a logic issue with the lapResetButton() function in the JavaScript. I plan on fixing this bug and updating the code.
- The CSS isn't 100% spot on, the actual iPhone stopwatch has another version with multiple dials. This would be a more complex project and is something that may potentially need a different software and programming language to create.
